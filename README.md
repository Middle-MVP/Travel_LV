# Tour Agency in next.js
using typescript & material components for react


### Furthermore, how to run this tour agency application:
=======
### 1. we are using Next.js and prisma, but there are some issues in the Prisma when you run on the VS-code terminal.
### 2. Use the (Command prompt or Terminal) pannel of Windows or Macbook, Don't use VS-code terminal.
1. 
    ```npm
    npm install
    ```
2. Configure **PostgreSQL** connection string in `.env`
3. Run **Prisma** commands to handle DB staff `prisma migrate dev` && `prisma generate`

    > If you face any troubles while running above prisma's commands, just install prisma globally via:

    ```npm
    npm i -g prisma
    ```

4. Run `npm run dev` and enjoy my majesty
5. Take into account the fact, that the `navigation bar` is currently disabled due to make it work much better in the future üëçüëç. In order to visit my stunning `registration form` you have to manually visit `/register` route.

## Let‚Äôs discuss a few of the potential use cases of blockchain in travel.

### 1. Loyalty Programs
Loyalty programs can be a great way to reward tourism providers for their loyalty, but they often require a lot of manual work and resources to manage on the user‚Äôs side.

A report from arrivia shows that ‚Äú59% of millennials say it‚Äôs either extremely or very important to be able to redeem points or miles when planning a trip.‚Äù And ‚Äú31% of industry leaders concede that conversion rates would improve if they offered more exclusive discounts.‚Äù

This presents tourism providers with the potential to use blockchain-based loyalty programs to create more engaging experiences and drive sales.

### 2. Smart Contracts
Smart contracts are digital agreements stored on the blockchain, allowing for reliable and secure agreements between tourism providers and travelers. This type of technology can be used to facilitate an end-to-end booking process and create trust between tourism providers and travelers.

These contracts are built to be automatically triggered when certain conditions are met, reducing the need for human intervention in the process. This helps eliminate discrepancies and provide relevant parties with accurate customer data.

Smart contracts offer many benefits, such as automatically issuing delays, cancellations, refunds, and verifying identities. By employing smart contracts, the travel industry can ensure faster, more secure, and more reliable agreements between tourism providers and travelers.

### 3. Decentralized Identity Verification
Decentralized identity verification allows users to securely verify their identity without relying on a central authority.

In addition to improved security, this solution enables faster data processing which helps reduce wait times for customer check-ins and other activities, ultimately leading to a better overall customer experience.

Allowing travelers to manage their digital identities better will enable data to be redistributed to the appropriate parties. This way, individuals have more control over their digital identities.

A decentralized identification system can also replace outdated identification documents like physical documents with more secure methods such as fingerprint and retina scans. 

Through the Alastria project, a blockchain technology that leverages decentralized digital identification, tourist operations can streamline their tasks and have a centralized repository of all relevant customer information.

### 4. Payment Processing
Payment processing through blockchain technology has the power to revolutionize travel transactions and streamline payments.

For example, research conducted at the University of Raharja suggested that adopting cryptocurrency as a payment method could free users from extra charges on the platform.

Blockchain technology enables global ledger transactions that are fast, secure, and cost-efficient. This makes it an ideal option for payment processing in the tourism industry, where payments are often made across borders and at high volumes.

Blockchain can also enable the use of smart contracts for travel payments to ensure secure and automated transactions.
